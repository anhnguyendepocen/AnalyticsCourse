This is the final optional assignment. After this assignment, you should be able to conduct the queries.

##Working with Dates

The one thing to note is that the RSQLite package does not work well with dates. For this reason, you should restrict your queries with dates using R.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

##Self-Joins

Self-joins on a table can be extremely useful to identify 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
