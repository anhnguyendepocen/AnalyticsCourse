## Your Assignment

Load all of the tables in the `RawSyntheticData` dataset (that are in in the `data` folder) into your SQLite Database. Remember, you will need to disconnect from the database using `dbDisconnect()` to save the tables into the database. You can do this after you write all the tables into the database.

Construct a query for each table to confirm that the number of rows of each loaded table is identical to the number of rows in the corresponding table you loaded into R. 

```{r}
