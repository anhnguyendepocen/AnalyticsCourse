## R Markdown

This week you had to answer two questions:

1) What is the maximum `Sepal.Length`? What units is it in? (Hint: look at the help file for the dataset again.)

2) How many rows are there total in the iris dataset?


## Maximum Sepal Length

First we load in the `iris` data. Then we call `summary()`.

```{r cars}
data(iris)

summary(iris)
```

Looking at the summary data, we notice that one of the values under the `Sepal.Length` column is "Max." This value is 7.9 centimeters (units can be found by using `?iris`)

## Number of Rows in the Data

This can be found by using `nrow()`. 

```{r}
nrow(iris)
```

By running this command, we find that `iris` has `r nrow(iris)` rows.
