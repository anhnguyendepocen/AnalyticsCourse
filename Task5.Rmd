This is the final optional assignment. After this assignment, you should be able to conduct the queries.

##Working with Dates

The one thing to note is that the RSQLite package does not work well with dates. For this reason, you should restrict your queries with dates using R.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

##Self-Joins

Self-joins on a table can be extremely useful when we need to identify rows within a table that meet criteria based on other rows in the table. For example, we may want to identify the first date a patient was admitted (the index admission date).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
