##Goals for this week

This week we will download the datasets, load them into R, and do some more simple descriptive statistics on them.

##The concept of a working directory

Let's load up Rstudio again. You can find out what your *working directory* is with the `getwd()` command.

```{r}
getwd()

##list all the files in my current working directory
list.files()
```

##Loading in Data

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
