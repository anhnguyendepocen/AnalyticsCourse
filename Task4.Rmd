This week we will be querying our database. We'll also be doing simple joins and queries to show the power of SQLite. We'll also be using the CASE statement to identify cases that meet our criteria.

If you haven't done last week's assignment (loading the dataset into SQLite), please do it now.

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
